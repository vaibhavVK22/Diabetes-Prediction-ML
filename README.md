Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection of diabetes is crucial for effective management and treatment of the disease. Machine learning algorithms can help in predicting the risk of developing diabetes by analyzing various factors such as age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, family history, and lifestyle habits. The problem statement for diabetes prediction using machine learning is to develop an accurate and reliable predictive model that can identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes and provide timely intervention to prevent or delay the onset of the disease. The model should be able to analyze large amounts of data and provide personalized risk assessment for each individual based on their unique characteristics. The goal is to improve early detection of diabetes and provide better healthcare outcomes for patients.
Used Linear model of Support Vector Machine Algorithm to predict if a person is Diabetic or Non-Diabetic.
